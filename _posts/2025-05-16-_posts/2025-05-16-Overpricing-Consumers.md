# **Introduction**
Uber, and Lyft, the 2 giants of the taxi industry, have often employed a tactic that many would see as unfair: Dynamic Pricing. The purpose of this is to help these companies boost up prices during high demand, which in turn forces the consumers to pay an exorbitant amount because they simply have no other option. As somebody who has fallen victim to this tactic many times, I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to understand this environment and see if I could build a model that would be able to predict price based on a myriad of factors. 

# **Data**
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices] and focuses on ride-sharing data collected in Boston during November 2018. It includes detailed information on both Uber and Lyft trips, capturing a range of variables that influence pricing. These factors include distance, cab type (Uber or Lyft), time of day, day of the week, surge pricing multipliers, weather conditions, and ride categories (such as UberX or Lyft Premier). The dataset provides a valuable snapshot of how dynamic pricing played out in a real-world urban setting, allowing for a deeper analysis of the pricing models these companies use and the external conditions that might drive fare increases.
