# **Which dataset did you work with? Where did you get it from?**
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a franchise-based cricket league that takes place in India every year from Late-March to Late-May. The league consists of 10 different teams that all compete to be crowned the champions. Unlike the American leagues, the IPL does not have a contract system, nor does it have a draft. Instead, it has an auction, where players are sold to the highest bidder. In most years, there is a mini-auction, where teams can release players who did not perform well in the previous year, and bid for new talent. However, every 3 years, there is a Mega-Auction. In this Mega-Auction, teams can only retain up to 6 players or less, with the rest of their squad (usually 25 players) heading to the auction. 

The 2025 IPL Auction was a Mega-Auction. My work combines 2 different datasets to conduct this analysis. I have a file that details the statistics for ***Batter*** and his winning bid in the auction, and another file with statistics for ***Bowlers***.

## **Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?**

The purpose of this analysis was to understand the relationship between the Winning Bid (Salary) of a player in the Mega Auction and his production in the 2024 IPL season. As a sportsman, I wanted to learn what key statistics IPL teams look at when they evaluate players, and understand the premise behind paying them that particular salary. 


## **Did you filter any countries out? How, and why?**


### **What conclusions can you draw about this dataset? What is your supporting evidence?**
