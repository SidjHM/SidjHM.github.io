**Introduction**



## **What indicators from the World Bank did you choose to look at besides population, life expectancy, and GDP per capita? Why?**

In addition to the core indicators of population, life expectancy, and GDP per capita, I chose to include the following indicators for a broader and deeper analysis of development:

**GDP (USD):**
While GDP per capita provides a measure of average economic output per person, looking at total GDP gives insight into the overall scale of a country’s economy. It highlights the nation’s position in global trade and investment, its capacity for international influence, and its ability to fund large-scale infrastructure or social programs. This indicator helps contextualize how economic resources are distributed within and across nations.

**Unemployment Rate (%):**
This metric reveals the proportion of the labor force without jobs but actively seeking work. It serves as a critical barometer for economic health, social stability, and government policy effectiveness. High unemployment rates often signal structural problems, while lower rates indicate strong economic performance.

**Access to Electricity (%):**
Electricity is a basic necessity for modern living, and this indicator reflects how accessible this resource is to the population. It is a direct measure of a country’s infrastructure and economic development. In nations with low access, the data reveals areas needing investment, while in developed economies, near-universal access showcases established systems.

**Mortality Rate (Per 1,000):**
Mortality rate provides essential insight into healthcare infrastructure, nutritional standards, and the impact of diseases on a population. This indicator helps assess the quality of life and public health initiatives in a country. Tracking this over time can reveal the effectiveness of health interventions and changing living conditions.

**Government Expenditure on Education (%):**
Education is central to a country’s long-term development. By measuring the percentage of GDP allocated to education, this indicator showcases the importance placed on human capital development. It helps to identify countries prioritizing education as a tool for economic and social progress.

**Children in Employment, Female and Male (%):**
Child labor reflects broader socio-economic issues. These indicators illustrate the pressures on families and the effectiveness of laws protecting children’s rights. Disparities between genders can also highlight cultural norms and inequalities within societies.
