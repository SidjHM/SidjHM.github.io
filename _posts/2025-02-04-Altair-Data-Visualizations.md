# **Graph 1: Lifespan of Cars**

![Lifespan of Cars](/assets/img/Cars.jpg)

The purpose of this data is to look at the different types of cars in the market, and showcase which of these cars has the longest potential lifespan over its entire lifetime. It is very interesting in the way the graphs were set up, from the variety in color schemes of the donut chart, to the concentric set-up, and how the ends of the charts lead to a horizontal line with the car and its values. I chose it because very interesting in the way it showed data, and I felt like it would be a good challenge for me to try and remake. 

**Marks:** 
Volume of the Pie chart 
**Channels:**
Color and Size of the Pie Chart


## **My Attempt**
I tried to replicate this graph using the actual data given on the website, but was unsuccessful. The concentric donut charts were extremely hard to generate, and I was unable to write code that accurately colored in different quadrants of the donut chart. In short, it was a failure.

Despite spending a lot of time, my efforts did not bear fruit, and I have nothing remotely similar to the actual graph. Hence, I shall not be putting an image here. My code will be on my Art of Data github repository.



# **Graph 2: Househunting**

The purpose of this data is to look at when and where the ultra-rich of different continents are likely to buy their homes. I chose it because very interesting in the way it showed data, and I felt like it would be an easier graph for me to make after a failed attempt at attempting an extremely had visualization. 

**Marks:** 
Rectangle

**Channels:**
X-Axis, Y-Axis, Color of Rectangle

## **My Attempt**
I tried to replicate this graph using Vega's Cars dataset, and was successful. I graphed the horsepower vs miles_per_gallon, setting the size of the bubble to indicate its weight, while each bubble's color indicated its country of origin. My github repository contains the image of my graph, while the interactive version is down below.
