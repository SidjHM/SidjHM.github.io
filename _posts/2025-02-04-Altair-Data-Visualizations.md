# **Graph 1: Lifespan of Cars**

![Lifespan of Cars](/assets/img/Cars.jpg)

The purpose of this code is to look at the different types of cars in the market, and which of these cars has the longest potential lifespan over its entire lifetime. It is very interesting in the way the graphs were set up, from the variety in color schemes of the donut chart, to the concentric set-up, and how the ends of the charts lead to a horizontal line with the car and its values. I chose it because very interesting in the way it showed data, and I felt like it would be a good challenge for me to try and remake.
